# Number_Facts
A simple site to display facts about random numbers according to the user's choice. It is built using Bootstrap, Vanilla JavaScript and Numbers API.

Sorry to say this won't work when hosted over HTTPS because the API uses HTTP. So, the fetch/ajax request gets denied. But this will work smoothly if you download the code and play around with it in your localhost. Cheers!
